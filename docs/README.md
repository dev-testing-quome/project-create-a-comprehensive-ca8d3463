* **Encrypted Data Storage:**  Ensures the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive client data, complying with attorney-client privilege.


**Technical Highlights:**

* **RESTful API:**  Clean and well-documented API built with FastAPI for easy integration with the frontend and other systems.
* **Asynchronous Tasks:**  Handles background tasks efficiently using asynchronous programming techniques. (Implementation details to be added)
* **Data Validation:**  Robust data validation to ensure data integrity and prevent errors.
* **Unit & Integration Testing:** Comprehensive testing suite to ensure code quality and stability. (Implementation details to be added)


## Technology Stack

* **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
* **Frontend:** React with TypeScript
* **Database:** SQLite (with SQLAlchemy ORM - easily swappable for PostgreSQL, MySQL etc. for production)
* **Containerization:** Docker
* **Authentication:**  [Specify authentication method, e.g., JWT, OAuth2] (Implementation details to be added)


## Prerequisites

* Python 3.11 or higher
* Node.js 18 or higher
* npm or yarn
* Docker (optional, but recommended for deployment)
* A code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)

* **API Documentation:** `http://localhost:8000/docs`
* **Alternative API Docs:** `http://localhost:8000/redoc`


## Usage

**(Examples will be significantly expanded upon in the actual project.)**

**Key Endpoints (Examples):**

* `/cases`:  Manage cases (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* `/clients`: Manage clients (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* `/documents`: Manage documents (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* `/auth/login`: User login endpoint
