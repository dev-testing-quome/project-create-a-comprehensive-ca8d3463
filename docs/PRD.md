**2. Overview:**

CLCMS is a web-based legal case management system designed to streamline workflows and improve efficiency for law firms of all sizes.  It provides a centralized platform for managing cases, deadlines, client communication, and documents, while ensuring robust security and compliance with legal and privacy regulations. The system's value proposition lies in its comprehensive feature set, user-friendly interface, and secure architecture, ultimately leading to reduced operational costs, improved client satisfaction, and increased profitability for law firms.

**3. Functional Requirements:**

* **Core Features:**
    * **Case Management:** Create, manage, and track cases with detailed information (client details, case type, status, etc.).
    * **Client Portal:** Secure access for clients to view case updates, documents, and communicate with their attorney.
    * **Calendar & Deadlines:** Integrated calendar with deadline tracking, automated reminders, and conflict checking for court dates.
    * **Document Management:** Secure storage, version control, and search functionality for case documents.
    * **Time Tracking & Billing:** Integrated time tracking system with billing features, generating invoices and reports.
    * **Communication Log:** Secure messaging system for client and internal team communication, maintaining a complete audit trail.
    * **Task Management:** Assign tasks to team members, track progress, and manage workflows.
    * **Court Date Scheduling:** Schedule court dates, manage conflicts, and generate court documents.
    * **Expense Tracking:** Track expenses related to each case and generate expense reports.
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Granular control over user access based on roles (attorney, paralegal, admin).
    * **Reporting & Analytics:** Generate custom reports on case status, billing, time tracking, and other key metrics.

* **User Workflows:**  Detailed workflows will be documented separately for each user role (attorney, paralegal, admin, client).  Examples include:
    * Attorney: Creating a new case, assigning tasks, reviewing documents, communicating with clients, generating invoices.
    * Paralegal: Managing documents, scheduling court dates, tracking deadlines, assisting with billing.
    * Admin: Managing user accounts, configuring system settings, generating reports.
    * Client: Accessing case information, uploading documents, communicating with their attorney.

* **Data Management:**
    * Secure, encrypted data storage complying with attorney-client privilege and relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
    * Data backups and disaster recovery plan.
    * Data import/export capabilities.

* **Integration Requirements:**
    * Integration with existing accounting software (e.g., QuickBooks).
    * Potential integration with e-filing systems.
    * API for future integrations.


**4. Non-Functional Requirements:**

* **Performance:**  System should respond within 2 seconds for most user actions.  Load testing will be conducted to ensure scalability.
* **Security:**  Robust security measures including encryption (both in transit and at rest), authentication (multi-factor authentication recommended), authorization (RBAC), and regular security audits. Compliance with relevant security standards (e.g., SOC 2).
* **Scalability:**  System should be able to handle a large number of users and cases concurrently.  Database and server infrastructure should be scalable.
* **Usability:**  Intuitive and user-friendly interface with clear navigation and helpful tooltips.  Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA).


**5. Technical Requirements:**

* **Technology Stack:**
    * Frontend: React.js
    * Backend: FastAPI (Python)
    * Database: PostgreSQL (with consideration for scalability â€“ potential for sharding in the future)
    * Cloud Infrastructure: AWS or GCP (to be decided)

* **API Specifications:**  RESTful API using OpenAPI specification (Swagger). Detailed API documentation will be provided.

* **Database Schema:**  A detailed database schema will be designed and documented, including data types, relationships, and indexes.

* **Third-Party Integrations:**  Specific APIs and SDKs for integrations with accounting software and other services will be identified and documented.


**6. Acceptance Criteria:**

* **Feature-Specific Acceptance Criteria:**  Detailed acceptance criteria will be defined for each feature, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing.

* **Success Metrics & KPIs:**
    * User adoption rate
    * Number of cases managed
    * Average time spent on tasks
    * Client satisfaction scores
    * System uptime

* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  UAT will be conducted with a representative group of attorneys and legal staff to ensure the system meets their needs.


**7. Release Criteria:**

* **MVP Definition:**  The MVP will include core features: Case management, client portal, calendar, document management, and secure messaging.

* **Launch Readiness Checklist:**  A comprehensive checklist will be created to ensure all aspects of the system are ready for launch, including testing, documentation, and training.

* **Post-Launch Monitoring:**  Continuous monitoring of system performance, user feedback, and security will be implemented.


**8. Assumptions and Dependencies:**

* **Technical Assumptions:**  Assumes availability of skilled developers proficient in FastAPI, React, and PostgreSQL.

* **Business Assumptions:**  Assumes sufficient funding and resources for development and deployment.

* **External Dependencies:**  Successful integration with third-party services (accounting software, e-filing systems) is dependent on their APIs and availability.


**9. Risks and Mitigation:**

* **Technical Risks:**  Integration challenges with third-party services, unexpected bugs, security vulnerabilities.
    * **Mitigation:**  Thorough testing, robust security measures, contingency plans for integration failures.

* **Business Risks:**  Market competition, changes in legal regulations, user adoption challenges.
    * **Mitigation:**  Market research, continuous monitoring of regulatory changes, effective marketing and user training.


**10. Next Steps:**

* **Development Phases:**  Agile development methodology with iterative sprints.

* **Timeline Considerations:**  A detailed project timeline will be created, including milestones and deadlines.

* **Resource Requirements:**  Detailed resource allocation plan including developers, designers, testers, and project managers.


**11. Conclusion:**
