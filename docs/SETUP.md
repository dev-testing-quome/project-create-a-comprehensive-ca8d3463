# Developer Setup Guide - project-create-a-comprehensive

This guide outlines the setup process for developers working on the "create-a-comprehensive" legal case management system.  We'll use a combination of Python (backend), React (frontend), and PostgreSQL (database).  Docker is the recommended approach for local development.

## Prerequisites

* **Required Software Versions:**
    * Python 3.9+
    * Node.js 16+
    * npm (or yarn) 
    * PostgreSQL 14+
    * Docker Desktop
    * Docker Compose

* **Development Tools:**
    * Git
    * Text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)

* **IDE Recommendations and Configurations:**
    * **VS Code:** Install the following extensions:
        * Python
        * ESLint
        * Prettier
        * Docker


## Local Development Setup

### Option 1: Docker Development (Recommended)

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd project-create-a-comprehensive
   ```

2. **Docker Setup:** Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running.

3. **Development Docker Compose Configuration:**  A `docker-compose.yml` file (provided in the repository) will define the services (backend, frontend, database).  It might look something like this:

   ```yaml
   version: "3.9"
   services:
     backend:
       build: ./backend
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
       environment:
         - DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@db:5432/case_management
         - SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key  # Replace with a strong secret key
     frontend:
       build: ./frontend
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       depends_on:
         - backend
     db:
       image: postgres:14
       ports:
         - "5432:5432"
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
         - POSTGRES_DB=case_management
   ```

4. **Hot Reload Setup:**  (This depends on your chosen tools; examples below)
    * **Backend (Python):** Consider using tools like `nodemon` (if you have a separate node server for API) or a development server built into your framework (e.g., `flask run --reload`).
    * **Frontend (React):** Use `npm start` or `yarn start`.  React's development server usually provides hot reloading.


### Option 2: Native Development

1. **Backend Setup (Python):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup (Node.js):**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```

3. **Database Setup:** Install PostgreSQL locally and create the `case_management` database.  Configure the database connection details (username, password) accordingly.


## Environment Configuration

1. **Required Environment Variables:**
   * `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (e.g., `postgres://user:password@host:port/database`)
   * `SECRET_KEY`:  A strong, randomly generated secret key for security.
   * `DEBUG`: Boolean value (True/False) for enabling debug mode.
   * Other environment variables specific to your application (e.g., email settings, API keys).

2. **Local Development .env File Setup:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with your local environment variables.  Example:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/case_management
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   DEBUG=True
   ```

3. **Configuration for Different Environments:** Use environment variables to manage settings for different environments (development, staging, production).


## Running the Application

1. **Start Commands:**
   * **Docker:** `docker-compose up -d`
   * **Native:** 
     * Start the backend server (e.g., `python manage.py runserver` if using Django).
     * In a separate terminal, navigate to the frontend directory and run `npm start` (or `yarn start`).

2. **Access Frontend and Backend:** The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your configuration).  The backend API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000` (or its specified port).

3. **API Documentation Access:**  Consider using tools like Swagger or Postman to document and test your API endpoints.


## Development Workflow

1. **Git Workflow and Branching Strategy:** Use Git for version control.  Employ a branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow) to manage features and bug fixes.

2. **Code Formatting and Linting Setup:** Use tools like Prettier and ESLint to enforce consistent code style.  Configure your IDE to automatically format code on save.

3. **Testing Procedures:** Write unit tests and integration tests using a testing framework (e.g., pytest for Python, Jest for React).

4. **Debugging Setup:** Use your IDE's debugging tools to step through code and identify issues.


## Database Management

1. **Running Migrations:** Use database migration tools (e.g., Alembic for SQLAlchemy) to manage database schema changes.

2. **Seeding Development Data:** Create scripts to populate the database with sample data for testing and development.

3. **Database Reset Procedures:**  Create scripts to easily reset the database to a clean state.


## Testing

1. **Running Unit Tests:**  Run your unit tests using the appropriate command for your testing framework (e.g., `pytest` for Python, `npm test` for React).

2. **Running Integration Tests:** Execute integration tests to verify the interactions between different parts of your application.

3. **Test Coverage Reports:** Generate test coverage reports to track the percentage of your code covered by tests.


## Common Development Tasks

1. **Adding New API Endpoints:**  Follow your framework's guidelines for creating new API endpoints (e.g., Django REST framework, Flask).

2. **Adding New Frontend Components:** Create new React components and integrate them into your application.

3. **Database Schema Changes:** Use migrations to manage changes to the database schema.

4. **Adding Dependencies:** Use `pip` (Python) or `npm` (Node.js) to add new dependencies.


## Troubleshooting

1. **Common Setup Issues:** Refer to the documentation for Docker, Python, Node.js, and PostgreSQL for troubleshooting common issues.

2. **Port Conflicts Resolution:**  Check if the ports used by your applications are already in use.  Change ports in your configuration files if necessary.

3. **Dependency Issues:** Carefully review your dependency versions and check for conflicts.

4. **Environment Variable Problems:** Verify that your environment variables are correctly set.  Use a `.env` file or your operating system's environment variable settings.


## Contributing

1. **Code Style Guidelines:** Adhere to the project's code style guidelines (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Airbnb style guide for React).

2. **Pull Request Process:** Create pull requests to submit code changes.  Include clear descriptions and address any feedback.

3. **Issue Reporting:** Use the project's issue tracker to report bugs and feature requests.  Provide detailed information, including steps to reproduce the issue.


This guide provides a solid foundation. Remember to consult the specific documentation for your chosen frameworks and tools as needed.  The specifics of commands and file locations will depend on the actual project structure.  This is a template to be adapted to your specific project.
